# Symbrium-Post-Interview
A github repo to house the C# code written to show adaptation skills. Here are the descriptions of the two chalenges I did.

# FizzBuzz
1. Print Fizz when a number is divisable by 3
2. Print Buzz when a number is divisable by 5
3. Print FizzBuzz when a number is divisable by 3 and 5
4. Make it only perform each division once????
5. Print Jazz when a number is divisable by 7
6. Make the numeric range chose by the user
7. Let the user add more rules and rank them


# DateTime Cal
1. Take a date input by the user
2. Calculate how many days ago it was
3. Take a time input by the user
4. Calculate how many hours and min ago it was
5. Allow 12hr or 24hr format
